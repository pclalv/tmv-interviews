Today he shares the first peak of the LP by way of “Paper Fish.” The single premiered via Flood Magazine and Ward told them &quot;Paper FIsh was the last song I wrote for Daggers, it seemed like it was the final piece of a puzzle I had been working on. It is rare for me to sit down, write and then sing something almost completely in one take- but that is what happened on this song. It was as if the process of making this record allowed me to finally break through and say exactly what I was trying to say. Life is a journey and for me that journey is 100% about being a better person. I think about and work towards this everyday. When I die, I want to die the best man I&apos;ve ever been.&quot; They say &quot;“Paper Fish,” the record’s first single, presents the album as a polished, more pop-informed take on Ward’s career in post-hardcore.Jim Ward has played in a slew of monumental bands, from the iconic post-hardcore band At The Drive-In to Sparta, as well his alt-country project, Sleepercar. “I’ve always used music as an outlet for anxiety and frustration,” notes Ward, and in fact, it’s this healing power of music, Ward offers, that led him to Daggers. “When my world has upheaval, it becomes about doing the work in front of me.”</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></body></html>
