I am absolutely thrilled to share my interview with Omar Rodriguez-Lopez with you all. Not only is Rodriguez-Lopez in amazing groups like At the Drive-In, The Mars Volta, Bosnian Rainbows, and Crystal Fairy -- he also started a series where he&apos;s bi-weekly releasing around twenty-four of his own solo records. The artistry and passion this man has is awe-inspiring.
Omar Rodriguez-Lopez is one of the most insightful and intriguing guests I&apos;ve ever had on AMBY, so it was a true pleasure having the opportunity to sit down with this musical genius to pick his brain. Indulge in our conversation as we discuss creating films, going out of his comfort zone, being a history buff, loving photography, and how music moves you.
I would also like to share a special shout out to my friend Teri from Le Butcherettes for some of the insider info (she was my secret source on this one!)
